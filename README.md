MiniBlog is a project created by me while practicing react concept. I have used HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and react concept to develop the frontend part.
I have used Appwrite as back as service.
In this miniblog project people can signin, then they will be directed to login page where they will login and can see addpost, allpost, home and logout option.
By clicking on addpost anyone can add a post who is already logged in.
